# GUI Handwriting Recognition with Python

In this project I attempt to make a Handwriting Classifier with Python and a Machine Learning Algorithm. This project incorporated a GUI that was made with Tkinter to allow the user to write thier own data points using the mouse cursor as a paintbrush/pencil. 

## TO-DO

There are a few things left desired out of this project. 

1. Use a neural network or another algorithm to classify the data so execution time can be drastically reduced.
2. Finish creating the data samples for the alphabet. (Currently finished with lower-case d)

### Prerequisites

•Numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
•PIL (Python Imaging Library)
```
pip install Pillow
```
•Tkinter
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
•ResizeImage 
```
pip install python-resize-image
```
